Assignment #4:

I want to analyze data on female genital mutilation in countries. I want to determine if it happens more in different areas of the world or across different age groups. I will also analyze what socioeconomic status it is more prevalent in along with attitudes towards the practice. I hypothesize that FGM will be more prevalent in poorer areas and will affect more young girls than older women.

My main source of data is the UNICEF. The data is mainly percentages of the prevalence of FGM and the percentages of men and women who oppose the practice. 

I am not able to make a plot using ggplot because I do not know how to clean the data yet (we talked about this together). I think bar graphs or line plots will work best for my data.
